This small project makes use of the "FastF1" library in Python. Started learning in it 2024 and thought the best way to understand will be to use it in tandem with the 2024 Formula One Season. 

PS: rememeber to create a folder called "cache" and make sure it's in the same directory as "main.py" or "sprint.py"
